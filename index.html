    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Our research focuses on the magnetic, dielectric, and structural properties of functional materials,  
        particularly transition metal and rare-earth oxides. The investigation involves studying  
        magnetoelectric behavior, magneto- and electrocaloric effects, and charge transport mechanisms in these materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using neutron diffraction, synchrotron X-ray techniques, and dielectric spectroscopy,  
        structural distortions and electronic states are analyzed to understand their influence on physical properties.  
        Additionally, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy is utilized to examine local and electronic structures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Experimental techniques are combined with advanced data analysis tools such as FullProf, JANA, and Demeter  
        to gain insights into the structure-property relationships in condensed matter systems.  
        This work aims to contribute to the development of next-generation functional materials.
