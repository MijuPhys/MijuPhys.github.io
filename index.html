    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated and accomplished researcher with a strong background in condensed matter physics, particularly in studying complex oxide materials' magnetic, dielectric, and structural properties. With expertise in advanced experimental techniques such as synchrotron data analysis, neutron diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, I have made significant contributions to the field through my work on doped multiferroic and pyroelectric oxides. My experience spans international collaborations, including experiments at renowned facilities like DESY, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source. I have published several papers in peer-reviewed journals, demonstrating my ability to conduct and communicate high-quality research. In addition to his scientific expertise, I have developed programming, data analysis, instrumentation skills, and handling tools such as CCR, VSM, and Python. My commitment to education is evident from my teaching experience as a visiting faculty member at JIS College of Engineering and my current work as a Senior Research Fellow and PhD candidate at North Bengal University, where I am also involved in collaborative research projects. My adaptability, curiosity, and passion for uncovering the intricate relationships between material properties make me a highly motivated and well-rounded researcher ready to take on complex challenges in academic and industrial settings.</p>
